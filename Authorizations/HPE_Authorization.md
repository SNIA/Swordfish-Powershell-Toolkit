Request for Participation
Redfish/Swordfish Interop Lab

The SNIA Tech Center is hosting Redfish hardware in partnership with the DMTF in an effort to help 
the protocol mature and increase adoption in the marketplace. There are a number of Server vendors 
who have placed hardware in this lab for compatibility testing. 

SNIA has written a Redfish/Swordfish PowerShell Toolkit that is vendor neutral, and designed to 
interoperate with Redfish/Swordfish Targets. This toolkit is being tested against all server 
manufacturers in the lab to ensure compatibility. 

The embedded help files in this toolkit that show people how to run these commands show sample output 
as well. The output from these servers could be used as one of the examples, but only if the vendors 
whose hardware it represents is agreeable to such inclusion. This 'free' advertising to consumers of the 
PowerShell toolkit is a value-add to your companies participation in the SNIA Interoperability Labs. 

If you currently have hardware in the SNIA Labs; please have a representative from your company 
respond to the following;

( ) My Company wishes to allow inclusion of sample output derived from our hardware in the toolkit as examples.

( ) My Company does not wish to have sample output derived from our hardware included in this toolkit as examples.

If we do not receive any response, we will assume that you do not wish for inclusion as a matter of course. 
Additionally you can request that your examples be removed at a future date as well if you so choose.

An additional benefit of participation is that you will receive reports from any failed tests that indicate 
non-compliance. If non-compliance is encountered, the example for that specific command will not be included 
since only successful tests will be used as test examples.

If your company does not have any hardware in the SNIA Tech Center, but would like to participate, 
please contact Richelle Ahlvers (SNIA SMI Chair) who can assist your company in co-locating the hardware. 

Note : We are unable to include examples from physical devices not present in the SNIA Tech Center as 
the goal for the toolkit is that each time it is updated or expanded, we may need to re-run the examples 
to ensure they work, and the output is unchanged.

This toolkit is currently located at; https://github.com/SNIA/Swordfish-Powershell-Toolkit

To post your company acceptance of this agreement, please fill in the following information, save the file 
using the format VendorName_Authorization and post it to the Github Repository in the Authorizations Folder.
