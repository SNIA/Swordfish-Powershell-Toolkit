# Windows PowerShell Toolkit for Swordfish
The PowerShell Toolkit for Swordfish provides a basic framework for querying resources from the [SNIA API Emulator](https://github.com/SNIA/Swordfish-API-Emulator). 

The SNIASwordFish PowerShell Module can be used with Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, macOS or Linux. Below is an example of a connected SwordFish target being used with macOS and PowerShell for Linux (v6.1).

## Feedback
If there is any feedback please use [Issues](https://github.com/SNIA/Swordfish-Powershell-Toolkit/issues) for tracking.

## Deployment Steps
1. Create a directory named SNIASwordFish in C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ 
2. Then import the module:
```powershell
PS:> Import-Module SNIASwordFish.psm1
```
3. Check to make sure the module has been loaded:
```powershell
PS:> Get-Module -Name SNIASwordFish
```
4. Once the module has been loaded a connect to a Swordfish Target using:
```powershell
Connect-SwordfishTarget -target 192.168.1.100
-or-
Connect-RedfishTarget -target 192.168.1.100

5. If your storage device requires an Autorization token, you can use the following command to obtain or populate this token. Once this token has been gathered, all further commands will attempt to use the token by default in the rest method header. 
Get-SwordfishSessionToken -target 192.168.1.100 -protocol https -Username chris -password P@ssw0rd!
```
This command will set the various global variables that other commands need to operate
```powershell
PS:> Connect-SwordFishTarget -Target 192.168.1.100
```
5. Once a connection has been made, you can issue other commands such as:
```powershell
Get-SwordFishStorageService
```
6. To view a complete list of commands, use the following:
```powershell
PS:> Get-Command -module SNIASwordFish
```
7. Documented help is available, use the following:
```powershell
PS:> Get-Help Get-SwordFishStorageService -Full
```
8. This module follows the PowerShell Verb/Noun model. Naming scheme is as follows:
```powershell
<Verb>-SwordFish<Noun>
```
All of the verbs are well known verbs and match the RestAPI CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to the standard Get-Set-New-Remove well known PowerShell verbs. To see a list of all the Verbs use the following:
```powershell
PS:> Get-Verb
```
In each case, the SwordFish Noun refers to a Folder that has been made singular. i.e. StorageServices --> StorageService
The Swordfish PowerShell module works with collections of objects. When you make a request for something like Storage Services, the commands will return an array of objects that represent each storage service. In these cases, you can limit the return to a specific storage service by specifying the storage service name to be returned:
```powershell
PS:> Get-SwordFishStorageService -StorageServiceID 1
```
9. To get subordinate information about an object, i.e to return information such as the power metrics for a chassis, additional commands have been added. The extra commands for this deeper information follow the naming scheme:
```<original_command><DetailNoun>```
An example of this would be the Power or Thermal metrics gathered by the Chassis object. These each have three detailed objects (metrics) under each of these detailed nouns; i.e. Power has as metrics <PowerControl>,<PowerSupplies>, and <Voltages>. So the command for this would appear as such:
```powershell
  PS:> Get-SwordFishChassisPower -MetricName Voltages
``` 
The current list of supported cmdlets are:
```powershell
Connect-RedfishTarget
Get-RedfishSession
Get-RedfishSessionToken
Get-RedfishSessionService
Get-RedfishStorage
Get-RedfishSystem
Get-RedfishSystemComponent
Get-RedfishChassis
Get-RedFishChassisPower
Get-RedFishChassisThermal
Get-RedfishDrive
Get-RedfishManager
Get-RedfishManagerComponent
  
Connect-SwordfishTarget
Get-SwordfishSessionToken
Get-SwordfishStorage
Get-SwordfishStorageService
Get-SwordfishSystem
Get-SwordfishSystemComponent
Get-SwordfishChassis
Get-SwordFishChassisPower
Get-SwordFishChassisThermal
Get-SwordfishSessionService
Get-SwordfishZone
Get-SwordfishTask
Get-SwordfishSession
Get-SwordfishConnection
Get-SwordfishController
Get-SwordfishDrive
Get-SwordfishEndpoint
Get-SwordfishEthernetInterface
Get-SwordfishGroup
Get-SwordFishPool
Get-SwordfishVolume
Get-SwordfishSession
Get-SwordfishManager
Get-SwordfishManagerComponent
Get-SwordfishClassOfService
Get-SwordfishDataStorageLinesOfService
Get-SwordfishDataStorageLoSCapabilities
Get-SwordfishIOConnectivityLoSCapabilities
```
### Alternate SwordFish Targets

The Swordfish PowerShell toolkit is designed to be used primarily against an actual Swordfish Implementation, however it works equally well against the SNIA SwordFish Emulator located at the following location https://github.com/SNIA/Swordfish-API-Emulator. To use the SwordFish PowerShell toolkit module, configure the API Emulator according to the instructions on the Github site.
To connect the SwordFish PowerShell Toolkit to either a Swordfish Implementation or the API Emulator use the command Connect-SwordFishTarget to the IP address that represents that target. See 
```powershell 
Get-Help Connect-SwordFishTarget
```
